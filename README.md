**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to implement a theme toggle feature using the Context API in React. When a button is clicked, the theme of the application should switch between light and dark modes.

    - Set up a ThemeContext using React's Context API to manage the theme state.
    - Define two theme options: light and dark.
2. **Theme Toggle Button:**
    - Create a button component that toggles between light and dark themes when clicked.
    - Implement the logic to switch the theme state accordingly.
3. **Theme Application:**
    - Apply the selected theme throughout the application using the useContext hook.
    - Ensure that components update their appearance based on the current theme.
4. **Additional Features (Optional):**
    - Add transitions/animations to the theme change for a smoother user experience.
    - Customize the appearance of components based on the selected theme (e.g., background color, text color).
